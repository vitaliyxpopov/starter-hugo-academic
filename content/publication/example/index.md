abstract: Augmented Reality (AR)-based simulation training off ers several unique features that provide acollection of dynamic behavioral data and increased immersion/realism while still providingopportunities for training healthcare professionals on critical â€˜high acuity, low frequency' events thatare diffi cult to recreate in real life. In this study, we used sequentialanalysis (i.e., a data analytic approach that helps detect patterns and temporal associations amongobserved behaviors) to investigate diff erential patterns of clinical decision-makingbehaviors in managing pediatric airway AR simulated scenarios between participants with variousspecialties and levels of training.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study contributes to the transformative use of Augmented Reality technology and learning analytics by providing a novel and practical application of this technology to assess clinical decision-making in the context of healthcare simulations.
